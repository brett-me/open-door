//   CH03-04 COMMENTS
// ================================================================================================
// idiomatic comment style starts with //
// block comments start with /* (good for debugging)
// generally comments are placed one line above the code they are annotating

// this is a main function
fn main() {
    // I add a blank println here so that there's seperation between compiler text and the program
    println!();
    println!("Hello, world!"); // comments may also appear next to a line of code
    // line below commented out as part of debugging process
    // test();
}

// example using block comment
/*
fn test() {
    println!("disabling this function as part of a debugging process");
}
*/

// different types of comments will be elaborated on in other chapters
